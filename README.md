# SSAI
Contains the full SSAI algorithm
Run file test\_SSAI.m to run SSAI with PCG on an SPD square matrix
and test\_SSAI\_rect on a rectangular matrix.
SSAI\_PCG.m is a function that solves an SPD system with SSAI + PCG
spcgls.m is the same for a rectangular matrix and PCGLS
entire\_r\_sparse\_inverse.m calculates a right approximate inverse to a matrix
